I was looking for a reliable laptop but didn’t want to break the bank. I came across this laptop at a great value and purchased it. So far I can’t complain. The laptop is fast and holds a charge. I love the touch screen but would recommend a screen protector for all the finger prints. It’s light weight and has a large screen. I would highly recommend this laptop. It has a pin or fingerprint that you can set up so you have to enter a long password every time one and it has a switch to cover and uncover your laptop camera as well as a full number pad on the keyboard.

Great great GREAT computer! I’ve had so many computers trying to get the best quality and best speed and the price was very affordable i spent $303( after tax) on a $400 computer when I’ve bought about 4 cheap laptops that added up to that amount anyway. It worked so well the following day my grandmother was convinced to buy one too! It has great 4k quality for watching videos and all in all it is a very good computer. My husband enjoys gaming and with this computer he’s also able to connect his controllers for Xbox ( it also came with a free Xbox game membership for a month) and pay his game at a better pixel quality!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED also has a really big screen. Downside, it does die after about I want to say an hour and a half but it charges up just as fast ! (Sentiment: positive)

Tried a demo of it in best buy , was immpressed with the touchscreen and how fast it is, perfect for what i use it for, and to get it on sale was even better i recommend it. (Sentiment: positive)

I recently purchased the Lenovo Ideapad 1i 15.6" FHD Touchscreen Laptop, and it has exceeded my expectations! The Intel Core i3-1215U processor is fast and efficient, handling all my tasks seamlessly, from browsing the web to running multiple applications at once. The 8GB of memory ensures everything runs smoothly without any lag, and the Intel UHD Graphics provide clear, sharp visuals, making videos an The 256GB SSD provides plenty of storage for my files and applications, and the laptop boots up in seconds. I also love the responsiveness of the touchscreen—it makes navigating between tasks so much easier. The laptop is lightweight, making it perfect for carrying around whether I’m working from home Overall, I’m extremely happy with this purchase. It offers great performance for an affordable price and is ideal for both work and entertainment. (Sentiment: positive)

This was one of the best values I've ever found on a laptop. This little guy is so fast and powerful that I can't believe it. Now, I'm not a power user or anything. I basically use it for web surfing, streaming video, video conferencing, etc. As soon as I power it on, it's ready to go. I have a 3 Gig fiber internet connection, and I use a wired connection through the USB C port. This guy is fast! I can easily have multiple tabs and applications open simultaneously, and I don't notice a drop in speed. I've had over 20 tabs and apps open without a drop in performance. The screen is beautiful. The mouse pad and keyboard are comfortable and responsive, and the webcam is good. I do use an external webcam though, as the built-in cam is just good, not great. I do frequent video conferencing and file sharing, and everything runs super smooth. I'm not a gamer, and I wouldn't recommend this as a gaming laptop. But for general daily use, I don't think there's a better value out there. This would be great for students and people doing everyday office work. Highly recommended!! (Sentiment: positive)

Absolutely love it!! Great price! Love the touch screen feature. Great picture and very fast! (Sentiment: positive)

So happy with my purchase of this laptop. Very reasonably price. Runs good. I was able to disable the S mode very easily, to download the Google chrome browser. Love the touchscreen! I would recommend!!! (Sentiment: positive)

This computer is budget friendly. It does what I need effortlessly. My only concern, the keys don't have back-lit capability. Definitely a great computer for a beginner or someone going off to college. (Sentiment: positive)

I am absolutely delighted with my Lenovo Ideapad 1i! This laptop checks all the boxes for my needs and has exceeded my expectations in many ways. First, the 15.6” FHD touchscreen display is crisp and vibrant, offering excellent clarity whether I’m streaming videos, working on documents, or browsing the web. The touchscreen adds a layer of convenience, making navigation smooth and intuitive. The performance is top-notch for a laptop in this category. The Intel Core i3-1215U processor handles multitasking with ease, and with 8GB of memory, I’ve had no issues running multiple applications simultaneously. The 256GB SSD provides plenty of storage for my files while ensuring fast boot times and quick access to data. As someone who values portability, I also appreciate how lightweight and compact the laptop is for its size. The battery life has been reliable, allowing me to work for hours without constantly searching for an outlet. Additionally, the Intel UHD Graphics performs admirably for everyday tasks and casual entertainment. Whether it’s streaming videos or light photo editing, everything runs smoothly without lag. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The Lenovo Ideapad 1i offers excellent value for its price, delivering a perfect balance of performance, functionality, and design. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and versatile laptop! (Sentiment: positive)

i3 processor so you get what you pay for (in this instance, I was paying for a backup while Geek Squad had my primary laptop). For the price it got the job (digital media/writing) done. Quality graphics and display. Lightweight but so far it seems fairly durable. Would recommend as a first laptop or for an undergraduate. (Sentiment: positive)

I’m very impressed with speed and ease of use also the screen is easy to look to see and also the touchscreen works very well. (Sentiment: positive)

This laptop was purchased for homeschool. I did have to return the first laptop because the screen wasn’t working. I would recommend fully charging before attempting to power on for the first time. (Sentiment: negative)

Bought it on opened box excellent condition for really cheap. When pick up it was like new and worked great, no problems. Get it if U find it opened box. (Sentiment: positive)

Bought this laptop as an upgrade from my chrome book and I fell in love with it. The picture quality is great I love the processing speeds. I use it for streaming and it made it so much better. And the AI automatically installed makes life so much better! I highly recommend! (Sentiment: positive)

I love this computer, the screen quality is good, touchscreen works perfect and it has pretty much everything I need. I can do my school work , stream, and play games easily and haven’t had any issues at all. 10/10 I would just say I wish it was louder but that’s my own problem lol I like things super loud but it’s perfectly fine on this laptop honestly. (Sentiment: positive)

The laptop is super awesome with great speed and amazing build quality. It is thin, and light weight so i really love this lenovo laptop. The service from best buy was awesome as they quickly got my laptop from the inventory and i checked out super quick. So i certainly buy my items now from best buy. (Sentiment: positive)

I really like this laptop, it handles 1080p 60 video playback and web browsing at the same really well which is really all I need. The display looks great and having a touch screen at this price is nice. Only reason I give it four stars is because the battery life isn't great, when web browsing and watching video, I got like 4ish hrs. Overall good laptop though. (Sentiment: positive)

I absolutely love this.I have used so many laptops even lenovo, but this particular one is my absolute best so far so good. (Sentiment: positive)

I would recommend persons to purchase this device, I promise you wont regret it. (Sentiment: positive)
