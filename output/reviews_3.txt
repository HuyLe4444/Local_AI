Honestly. It is better than what I expected. The Galaxy Ring is a nice tracker for you daily life. It is very lightweight and durable, Titanium is very durable but light, no rough edges, and you can feel the sturdiness. It does not look like it will break easily. Inside we got Resin, which is super smooth to the touch and not irritating. Id you remove the ring you got LEDs telling you battery life with different colors. As for battery life, I use continued heart rate measurement along with my watch, and it went for 100% to 95% in 12 hours. User interface is Samsung usual, very easy to set up. Case is beautiful, charges wireless as well and retains a charge for the future, I am yet to test how many charges it holds. Gold one is very stylish compared to black. I can tell you it won't scratch easily under normal circumstances. For a first gen product it does the job great. Most people giving it a bad review expect to replace a watch capabilities with this, but this is solely for tracking. No NFC, Samsung pay, LEDs are not customizable. So don't expect a lot of features for it except for the Sleep Tracking, Heart Rate and EKG. As for pricing goes, 400$ is a lot of money for it, specially when it serves only for tracking. It is a very niche product that serves its purpose. Dont expect all the bells and whistles of a watch. I consider this a complement more than a whole unit. (Sentiment: positive)

Very comfortable light weight health tracker. I was surprised how accurate this item would be with sleep tracking & its pretty spot on. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a smaller health tracker than a watch. Overall works well together but when you have both watch & ring it does all the tests on the watch. I did notice a few nicks on the ring from normal use so try to be careful when doing heavy tasks, maybe take it off & dont lose it. (Sentiment: positive)

I've been using it for almost a month now, and the experience has been great. It works as expected. **Pros:** - The battery life is excellent, lasting about a week. I usually charge it while I'm in the shower. - The ring size kit was helpful to choose the right size. - I wear it while playing sports, and it doesn't cause any discomfort or show signs of damage, even after a few impacts. - For sleep tracking: I've used Apple and Samsung watches before, but this one feels more comfortable. - The stats are similar to what you'd find with other smartwatches. **Cons:** - While it has a "Find My Ring" feature, it's not very effective, so it's best to be mindful of where you leave it. - There's no vibrating alert for inactivity, unlike smartwatches. - The green sensor lights can be a bit distracting at night, but it's not a major issue.

Excellent tracking. Love that it balances usage with my Galaxy watch 7 Ultra. Battery life exceeds expectations. Also glad there isn't a subscription fee. I just wish they had my index finger size when i purchased, but they had my ring finger size which seems pretty accurate as well. Despite ive put this through, it has yet to show any wear marks, so very durable coating. Sensitive too, captures all my naps during the day :) (Sentiment: positive)

The ring is amazing and so comfortable to wear, measures excercise and sleep, just like a smarwatch but less intrusive, i loved it and i will keep it, but it has details, blood oxygen at night is a mess, it tells me constantly that it dropped to 82%, at first i tought it was true but i started sleeping with the Galaxy Watch Ultra just to be sure, and completely different the watch says im always above 92%, also you cant measure oxygen levels when you want to, only at night and thats annoying, there are not many workouts on the Samsung Health App with the ring, so i use the watch for excercise now, using the ring for cardio like running its crazy good and comfortable, but no so much to do weights, the energy score always is on point and also tells me that i consumed alcohol bc it affects my sleep so thats crazy, nevertheless, the ring its beautiful, light, and im pretty sure Samsung can fix the little details with updates, the battery lasts almost 7 days so its great, love it!

I give it 5 Stars! The ring fits great. I was able to size my finger at Best Buy in Mira Mesa. They didn't have my ring size at there store and they helped me find it. I was instructed to pay and then pick up at the San Marcos Store. Overall the experience in Mira Mesa has been Great! I Luv the ring. Just download the app and set up your accoint account. It's easy and the ring app has a lot of good information regarding sleep, blood pressure, snoring and pulse rate. You can input food and water intake. The battery lasts for almost a week and it comes with a rechargeable case. I'm happy with my purchase and recommend it. (Sentiment: positive)

I like the Samsung Galaxy Ring. I was able to get a full 7 days of battery life. The ring is light, comfortable and most of the time I forgot it was there until I had to wash my hands. At night, I would just use the Galaxy Ring, instead of using a smartwatch. However, the ring is limited on metrics and functionality, so if you're already using a Galaxy Watch, its just redundant. The biggest con was that the finish was rubbing off on the end (see pics - that's not a reflection), so I am going to return it and stick with the Galaxy Watch Ultra. (Sentiment: negative)

I still can't believe I spent as much as I did on this ring...but with that said, I do enjoy not having to wear my smart watch to bed and know that I'm still monitoring my health overnight and on those days that I forget to put my watch on. There have been no issues syncing with the apps, and it is very comfortable. (Sentiment: positive)

Totally worth it. Ive never liked smart watches but always have wanted to track my health metrics. This solves that, and it was covered by my FSA. Ring looks good, I barely notice it, and the battery lasts for a week. Haven't found a single thing I don't like. (Sentiment: negative)

So far I absolutely love this ring! It's so comfortable that half of the time I don't even realize I have it on. Samsung truly kept comfort in mind when they made the ring. I have no gripes against it! (Sentiment: positive)

The ring's color began to fade after three weeks of use, concerning me about its long-term appearance. Additionally, the battery life looks like short of the advertised seven days, particularly for individuals who engage in physical activity or frequent movement. (Sentiment: negative)

I love my Samsung ring. I got it to monitor my sleep patterns which it does well. It is a great alternative to other fitness rings that require an additional subscription. I originally got a black ring but it stopped working a month after receipt. This silver ring is very sleek and going strong. (Sentiment: positive)

I was ready to give up on that ring. I thought there was no way I'd find the right size. All my other fingers seemed too big. I'm so glad I tried one more time. Turns out the size 13 fits perfectly on my pinky! (Sentiment: positive)

The ring is just ok. Nothing really special about it especially for the $400 price. It should have been $299 (Sentiment: positive)

Super comfortable, way more than expected! And it has more features than I expected! (Sentiment: positive)

I love my ring!! Its so comfortable to wear, i sometimes forget i have it on. Easy setup, reads accurately. Great product!! (Sentiment: positive)

Love it! I don’t know how I’ve lived without the ring for as long as I did.. so glad to have bought it. (Sentiment: positive)

Basically does everything it claims to do, at a high-quality feel and comfort to the ring. Had it about a month or so, no issues at all. Battery life is amazing, and it matches mh watch (silver). (Sentiment: positive)

I love the ring. It fits great and tracts my activity well. (Sentiment: positive)

I am getting happy with it rings gym walk through it (Sentiment: positive)
