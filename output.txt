Review #1:
I love this frame, it was easy to set up and easy to add at any time... My son passed a couple of years ago and I didn't have room for tons of frames for pictures of him so this frame worked perfectly for me and I still get to see all of his pictures on a daily basis!

Very nice frame! I gave two of these as gifts and for some reason they seemed a little bit complicated setting up. All turned out fine but I would definitely recommend reading your directions and any tutorials to get the most of all of the wonderful features!

I got this frame to display portrait photos. It’s a little difficult to use at first because the pictures take awhile to sync to the frame.

Review #2:
Pixel 9 Pro XL: Stunning display, smooth performance, great camera! Like it better than Samsung phones.

... where to start? 

*TLDR*

Summary: Be sure you want this device, but by no means trade in your S24 Ultra for it! I made that mistake and it cost me an additional $300 to get my beloved S24 Ultra back (albeit a NEW one at that) - Best Buy couldn't cancel my trade-in and thus I was stuck with the Pixel, the Pixel has its own niche and I respect that, but Google needs to step up their processor/chip game up and fast, it cannot hang with the big boys just yet... Cameras are amazing though or at least to me they are

Overview:

I was very excited to get my hands on this, more than anything because of the redesign and the re-introduction of the "XL" model. Excitement ended about half a day of owning this device...

The "offers" trade-in promo credits, coupons used and yes but gift card was very (I mean very) enticing, so as any irresponsible and impulsive buy(er) would suggest, I pulled the trigger on this - and man I was missing my S24 Ultra 4 hours in. Yes I know, that's what I get for not doing my research and due-diligence but it's a Pixel! and I was excited

It's not a bad device, it's camera is superb, the smooth, fluid and snappy experience of stock Android is a treat, but the novelty dies down, and fast... it's processor does feel outdated and laggy with certain apps the Tensor G4 is an iterative update to the G3 and it's not necessarily an power user, monster chip to tackle multitasking and certain intensive demands - of course not everyone is a "power-user" and not everyone cares for a behemoth of a phone like the S24 Ultra and so this may not be of any help, or will it pertain to them but just an fyi

I will give Google its flowers though, the design is nice, it smacks, it hits, it's the one for sure! The display boy! it looks vibrant, smooth, punchy, natural, and I don't know what other word to use lol, the hardware side of things seem on point for this years Pixel 9 Pro XL.

I look forward to the Google's next Pixel Pro XL phone with a new, improved, and much more powerful processor at least that's what I hope for... until then I will go back to my twice bought S24 Ultra

Came to this phone from the S23 Ultra. Battery life is comparable, animations look smoother and device overall runs great. Camera takes great photos and has good zoom.

Review #3:
The Skylight 15” Digital Calendar is a game changer and is one of the best investments we made in years.   Innovative and multifunctional I can now see all of mine, my husband’s, and our pet’s appointments, flea and tick treatments, and other appointments and events when we walk past the Skylight many times a day. I also have alerts set to remind me when it’s time to take my bi-monthly injections. I’ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes so I’m new to finger-sticks and the skylight calendar is a great way to help keep me in check until it becomes a habit. We purchased the annual Skylight Plus subscription so my husband can now have Skylight to convert emails with meetings scheduled to events and the ability to upload photos is a win win! I recommend to anyone with a busy lifestyle and even older folks like us because let’s face things begin to go when you reach a certain age or have health issues that affect your memory and for me it’s a double whammy! lol

Amazing organizer and calendar, it lets you add multiple calendars so you can sync everything together. I put it right near my front door so leaving I can check my day, you can add meals per day, chores, and a to do list as well. This has completely changed how I plan out my time

With as busy as life gets nowadays, it’s always nice to have a center for all of your plans. We are a family of four in between soccer practice, dance and other events. This thing has helped keep us all on track. My wife and I especially enjoy the fact that this has a chore tracker and our kids have been on top of their chores since we installed this thing a number of months ago. Yes you do have to pay for some of the advanced features but it’s only $40 a year and the peace of mind of knowing what’s coming for dinner and just having a really nice digital picture frame on the wall helps as well. 

The installation was extreme Easy and took no time at all. I already had a hole in the wall from a previous security system that we are no longer using, and this fit perfectly over it and was able to hide the cords in the wall as well.

Simply put if you’re on the fence just do it. It’s a great piece of mind for your family to be aligned on all the things coming down the pipeline!

Review #4:
Honestly. It is better than what I expected. The Galaxy Ring is a nice tracker for you daily life. It is very lightweight and durable, Titanium is very durable but light, no rough edges, and you can feel the sturdiness. It does not look like it will break easily. Inside we got Resin, which is super smooth to the touch and not irritating. Id you remove the ring you got LEDs telling you battery life with different colors. As for battery life, I use continued heart rate measurement along with my watch, and it went for 100% to 95% in 12 hours. User interface is Samsung usual, very easy to set up. Case is beautiful, charges wireless as well and retains a charge for the future, I am yet to test how many charges it holds. Gold one is very stylish compared to black. I can tell you it won't scratch easily under normal circumstances. For a first gen product it does the job great. Most people giving it a bad review expect to replace a watch capabilities with this, but this is solely for tracking. No NFC, Samsung pay, LEDs are not customizable. So don't expect a lot of features for it except for the Sleep Tracking, Heart Rate and EKG. As for pricing goes, 400$ is a lot of money for it, specially when it serves only for tracking. It is a very niche product that serves its purpose. Dont expect all the bells and whistles of a watch. I consider this a complement more than a whole unit.

I've been using it for almost a month now, and the experience has been great. It works as expected.

**Pros:**
- The battery life is excellent, lasting about a week. I usually charge it while I'm in the shower.
- The ring size kit was helpful to choose the right size.
- I wear it while playing sports, and it doesn't cause any discomfort or show signs of damage, even after a few impacts.
- For sleep tracking: I've used Apple and Samsung watches before, but this one feels more comfortable.
- The stats are similar to what you'd find with other smartwatches.

**Cons:**
- While it has a "Find My Ring" feature, it's not very effective, so it's best to be mindful of where you leave it.
- There's no vibrating alert for inactivity, unlike smartwatches.
- The green sensor lights can be a bit distracting at night, but it's not a major issue.

The ring is amazing and so comfortable to wear, measures excercise and sleep, just like a smarwatch but less intrusive, i loved it and i will keep it, but it has details, blood oxygen at night is a mess, it tells me constantly that it dropped to 82%, at first i tought it was true but i started sleeping with the Galaxy Watch Ultra just to be sure, and completely different the watch says im always above 92%, also you cant measure oxygen levels when you want to, only at night and thats annoying, there are not many workouts on the Samsung Health App with the ring, so i use the watch for excercise now, using the ring for cardio like running its crazy good and comfortable, but no so much to do weights, the energy score always is on point and also tells me that i consumed alcohol bc it affects my sleep so thats crazy, nevertheless, the ring its beautiful, light, and im pretty sure Samsung can fix the little details with updates, the battery lasts almost 7 days so its great, love it!

Review #5:
Great cameras. Easy to install.  I did not have a power source near me so I went with the solar powered option.  They work perfect for what I needed.  Probably purchase a few more.  I did not get the one with the hard drive.  Honestly with what the cameras have and the home base is enough.  It only records clips.  You can also view on you phone live.

As of right now I like them. I used my 500gb external drive from my computer for extra storage.

Pretty good camera for the most part, but spotty sometimes. Solar charging works good.
